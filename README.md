# Brain Tumor Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a deep learning solution for brain tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Brain tumor detection is a critical aspect of medical imaging, aiding in timely and accurate diagnosis. The solution encompasses dataset preprocessing, model training, and performance analysis to classify brain MRI images into four categories: Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, No Tumor, and Pituitary Tumor. By automating the detection process, this project aims to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of diagnostic procedures.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Preprocessing**: Includes normalization, augmentation, and handling of missing data.
- **CNN-Based Model**: Designed and trained to classify brain MRI images with high accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Detailed analysis of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization Tools**: Training performance and confusion matrix visualization.
- **Reproducible Pipeline**: Code and notebooks for easy replication and experimentation.
